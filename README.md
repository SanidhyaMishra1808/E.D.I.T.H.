# E.D.I.T.H.

## Overview
E.D.I.T.H. (Enhanced Driver Interface for Transcendent Heuristics) is a comprehensive driver assistance system designed to enhance road safety by simultaneously detecting driver drowsiness and monitoring lane positions. In case of detecting drowsiness, E.D.I.T.H. triggers an alarm, reduces the vehicle's speed, and navigates it safely to the side lane.

## Features
- **Driver Drowsiness Detection:** Utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to monitor the driver's eye movements and facial expressions.
- **Lane Detection:** Continuously monitors lane markings to ensure the vehicle remains within its designated lane.
- **Safety Protocols:** On detecting drowsiness, it triggers alarms, decelerates the vehicle, and steers it to a safe stop by the side of the road.
